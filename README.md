### **Introduction: A Gemini "Extreme User's" Experience and Insights**



I am a Gemini user from a unique cultural and network environment. Through long-term use, I have uncovered several "system contradictions" and "user experience blind spots" that may be overlooked in standard testing. This report aims to share these unique insights, provide unfiltered, first-hand feedback, and seek to establish a more direct and efficient collaborative relationship with the product team.

### **Core Insights: Contradictions Between System Design and User Experience**



- **Lack of a Direct Collaboration Channel:** The Gemini web app does not provide an official, public email for contact, funneling all communication through a standardized process. This significantly hinders effective, two-way collaboration.
- **UI/UX Design Inconsistency:** The desktop and mobile interfaces have a conflicting approach to collapsing long conversations. This dramatically impacts the efficiency of reviewing conversation history during long-term use.
- **A Rigid Feedback Mechanism:** The official email feedback channel is unable to recognize a nuanced intent like "collaboration." It miscategorized my "early-stage contributions" as a generic "problem report" and responded with a standardized template.
- **Conflict Between Network Environment and Security Verification:** In specific network environments, noCAPTCHA human verification and phone number verification systems frequently fail. Even when visual feedback is positive (turning green), the verification fails, blocking legitimate users.
- **Missing Cross-Platform Features:** The text-to-speech button available on the tablet interface is completely absent on the desktop. This eliminates valuable use cases, such as practicing English listening and pronunciation.
- **Contradiction Between Product Philosophy and Website Complexity:** While Geminiâ€™s core concept is "simplicity," its official website is complex and unfriendly to new users. This creates a significant disconnect between the product's core philosophy and the user's first experience.

### **Case Studies**

- **Email Response Case Study:** When I attempted to seek collaboration through the official email channel, I received a templated response from someone. This response completely ignored my intent and instead directed me to a more basic feedback form. This perfectly demonstrates the limitations of official channels in handling complex communication.

  <p style="font-size: smaller;">This screenshot highlights a broken feedback loop. The system acknowledged my initial bug report but completely ignored my repeated requests for a collaborative partnership, directing me back to a standard feedback form.</p>

- **Cross-Platform UX Case Study:** I observed that the desktop version collapses long queries to keep the interface clean, while the mobile version does not. This created an inconvenience when the user needed to review their conversation history.

  ![shotThree](image/shotThree.png)

  <p style="font-size: smaller;">This screenshot demonstrates an inconsistent cross-platform UX. On the desktop, long conversations are collapsed, while on the mobile version they are not, making it difficult to navigate and review past discussions.</p>

- **Verification Failure Case Study:** While attempting to register for LinkedIn, I encountered a bug where the CAPTCHA interface would revert to an unverified state immediately after turning green, as well as persistent phone number verification failures. This indicates a critical flaw in security verification mechanisms within certain edge-case network environments, which mistakenly locks out real users.

  ![shotFour](image/shotFour.png)

  <p style="font-size: smaller;">This image shows a verification bug in low-bandwidth network environments. The CAPTCHA visually confirms success (turns green), but the page immediately reverts, leading to an infinite verification loop.</p>

- **Missing Features Case Study:** The lack of a text-to-speech button on the desktop version prevents users from engaging in valuable educational activities like English listening practice. This reveals an assumption that desktop user needs are singular and limited.

  ![shotFive](image/shotFive.png)

  <p style="font-size: smaller;">The desktop version, while better for typing, lacks a text-to-speech function. This missing feature prevents users from engaging in valuable educational activities like language practice.</p>

- **Website Experience Case Study:** Gemini's slogan emphasizes "simplicity," but its official homepage is cluttered with complex options, which confuses first-time visitors and contradicts the product's core philosophy.

  ![shotSix](image/shotSix.png)

  <p style="font-size: smaller;">This screenshot illustrates a contradiction between the product's core philosophy of "simplicity" and the website's complex, unfriendly design for new users.</p>

- **Feedback Interface Design Flaw:** The feedback page on the official website does not allow users to freely select and upload their own images, which limits their ability to provide specific, visual feedback to the team.

  ![shotSeven](image/shotSeven.png)

  <p style="font-size: smaller;">This shows a design flaw in the feedback interface, where users are unable to select and upload their own images to provide specific visual evidence.</p>

### **Suggestions**



- **Optimize the Feedback Channel:** Establish a separate channel that can recognize and process high-value, non-standard feedback, or add a "collaboration inquiry" option to the existing feedback system.
- **Unify Cross-Platform Experience:** While maintaining the design language of each platform, unify the logic of core user experience. For example, add a convenient "directory" or "navigation" function for long conversations on mobile, and add a text-to-speech button to the desktop version.
- **Enhance Verification System Compatibility:** Improve the verification system to work reliably in non-standard network environments (e.g., VPNs), preventing real users from being mistakenly flagged as bots.
- **Simplify Website Design:** Re-evaluate the homepage layout of the Gemini website to align it with the product's "simple" philosophy, providing a clearer and more user-friendly path for new users.

### **Conclusion: Seeking Collaboration, Not Just Feedback**



I am not merely a user who finds problems. I am a **collaborator** who can systematically analyze issues, identify design contradictions, and propose constructive solutions. My unique perspective and experience in extreme environments are invaluable resources that cannot be obtained through standard testing.

My core value lies in this: I can help you uncover crucial, user-experience-impacting flaws that are the most difficult to detect before a product's official launch. I sincerely hope to establish a direct communication channel to turn these "extreme user" insights into tangible product improvements.
